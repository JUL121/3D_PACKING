content: The Bin Packing Problem is defined as the placement of a  set of
  different-sized items into bins so that the number of bins used is minimized.
  Specific cases of the problem vary according to the dimensions of items/bins,
  priority and placement constraints, and the planning horizon. The problem
  has important applications in Supply Chain Management, including vehicle,
  container, pallet or cargo loading, cutting stock and trim loss problems,
  packaging design, resource allocation, load balancing, scheduling, project
  management and financial budgeting.
